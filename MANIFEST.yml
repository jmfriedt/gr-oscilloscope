  The gr-oscillope provides means to collect samples from an oscilloscope and stream to a GNU Radio flowchart. While a radiofrequency grade oscilloscope provides utmost bandwidth, the datasteam is obviously not continuous due to the limited communication bandwidth, but the application is well suited when comparing data collected on multiple synchronous channels of an oscilloscope, e.g. for RADAR applications.
